# Thompson Sampling

""" There is a company trying to promote their product through advertisements and came up with 10 possible
advertisements. One advertise should be selected among the available 10 videos so that it can attrat the maximum 
customers. The attentions of the custromers can be captured from a sample of 10000 advertisements and the 
" click through rate" of each add displayed. The add that got the highest attention can be seen by using 
the Thompson Sampling algorithm."""
